    "For this exercise, we will assume that we run a small security company that provides physical security services in the area and we recently won a new contract in the area to provide 24x7 security to a small building under construction. We have 6 security guards available at the moment who you can assign to this building but our goal is to make more money out of this contract and spend less in wages (hence greedy!). Any employee working eight hours or less is paid 15 dollars per hour, while any employee working more than 8 hours is paid 20 dollars per hour."

While that might not be easy to see in a simple example, like the one above, as soon as these problems become more complex then it will become more noticable. By moving to a greedy algorithm, we reduce the solve time from exponential time O(2^n) to linear time, O(n)."
